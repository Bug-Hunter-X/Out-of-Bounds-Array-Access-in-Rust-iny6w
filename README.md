This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: accessing an array element using an index that is out of bounds.  The `bug.rs` file contains the erroneous code, which panics at runtime. The solution is shown in `bugSolution.rs`, demonstrating how to prevent this panic through error handling.  This example showcases the importance of carefully checking array indices in Rust to maintain program stability.
